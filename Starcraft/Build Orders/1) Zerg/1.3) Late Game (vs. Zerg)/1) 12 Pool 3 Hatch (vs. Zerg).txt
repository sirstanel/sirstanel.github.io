12 Pool 3 Hatch (vs. Zerg)

9 - overlord
12 - pool
12 - hatch at expo
Save larvae
@100% pool - 6 lings (3 larvae)
14 - macro hatch at expo (placed in a way to minimize amount of spores needed)

This build is very fluid after the third hatch goes down. Ling counts, sunkens, when spores are made, when gas is taken, all of these decisions are circumstantial and based off of scouting or intuition. 

Example transition to Hydra against 12 Pool Expand
Note: The following transition is weak to heavy ling play, but does well against mutaling players if you are not confident in your own mutaling control.

Continue producing lings until you scout your opponent.
15 - gas
Standard rush timings for 9 pool should pass, you can probably switch to drones after 8-10 lings
16 - overlord
Add a sunken
@88 gas - pull drones 1 by 1 from extractor
@100 gas - zergling speed
22 - overlord
Note: add overlords as needed from this point
@80% opponent's spire / around 5:10 - add evo chamber
Add 2 spores per base to cover the mineral line
Add sunkens/spores if necessary (for example to cover ramp - busting your ramp with ling/muta is an easy way to lose when powering drones)
30-32 - add hydra den (hidden from first line of sight)
@100% den - get +1 carapace, hydra speed, 2nd gas, start hydra production
Add spores if necessary, hide hydra for as long as possible
@50% +1 carapace - get 2nd evo
@2nd evo - get +1 ranged attack
@100% hydra speed - get hydra range
@100% hydra range - move out to pressure, +1 ranged attack will soon finish
Start +2 carapace, +2 ranged attack, queen's nest
Take 3rd expo
Note: If opponent gets to hive/defiler start lurker aspect and switch to a hydra/lurker composition
@100% queen's nest - build queen, research ensnare, start hive
Sunken/spore 3rd
@100% hive - start +3 carapace, +3 ranged attack, defiler den
@100% defiler den - consume
@100% consume - plague
