@100 gas - lair and take 1 drone off gas
Make 8 zergling
Make a drone and put it on gas
@100% lair - spire
Drones/lings/sunks depending on the situation

9 Pool Lair is all about getting fast muta. Try and get there without dying to lings and then use the muta (and hopefully good muta control) to dominate the air. Here are a few basic tips vs diff opponent openings:

- 12 hatch: you kill the hatch or a lot of drones
- 12 pool: you try and make them waste time pulling their drones for defence (maybe even snipe a drone), but drone behind and only make 8 lings or so, build sunks if they commit to building lots of lings, which they usually do (you can't match them by building lings yourself, as you are down a hatch and dont have ling speed...)
- 9 pool speed: you stay defensive at your choke/ramp and try and build some drones while having enough lings to hold... should work without a sunk if you do it right... they have speed and you don't, so you cant be out on the map when that kicks in...
- 9 pool lair (mirror): it is a mirror, you can try various things to get an edge... e.g. earlier expo, go for a muta upgrade and stay defensive until it finishes, try and keep track of his ovi movement and snipe more overlords with the initial mutas than he finds...
