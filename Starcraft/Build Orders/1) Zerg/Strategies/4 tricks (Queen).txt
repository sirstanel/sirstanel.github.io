zero just released a new video about 4 tricks all zergs should know
1. extending zergling range (spam right click on the scv)
2. extending sunken colony range so you can hit cannons but they can't hit you (build a sunken so it's in range of the pylon + enemy cannon is hitting your hatch)
3. stopping turrets from shooting with a muta  (spam m-click with 1 muta and press H when you're directly above)
4. double damage lurker spine (lurker shots right as they die can do double damage or more, useful when lurker dropping so you can 1 shot probes or marines)
