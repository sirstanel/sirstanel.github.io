2 Hatch Muta (cRoSsy style) #2 (vs. Terran)

9 - overlord
12 - hatchery
11 - spawning pool
10 - gas in main
@100% pool 2-4 zergling
@100 gas - lair
16 - overlord
@100 gas - zergling speed
@100% lair - spire
spire starts - take nat gas
Make drones and lings until 26/26
Note: you should only need 6-8 lings
26 - build 3rd hatchery at expo
25 - build 2 overlords
25 - build muta

If terran moves out to force sunkens you can
- opt to make lings instead of drones and make up to 16 lings to smash the force
- make one sunk and defend at home
- threaten to backstab with 6-8 lings and see if they react

If they decide to bust you when you make 1 sunk, pull drones back, let the sunken buy you time, fight with 6-8 muta. The better counter is to make the lings.

If the terran's force is very large you may need 2 sunkens. Usually you don't and usually they only move out and come back to force sunkens. If the terran loses this first m&m group they are behind.
