2 hatch lurker into fast defiler (vs. Terran) (Effort vs Flash ASL S6 Finals GM 4)
12 hatch
11 pool
10 gas
4 lings when pool finishes -> hunt down SCV, send 1 to scout moveouts if no ovie at terran nat
16 lair
16 overlord
16 ling speed
16 2 more lings
18 hydra den (Effort puts it down at 100 gas, priority is it not being scouted)
19 2 more lings -> block own ramp/choke

22 natural gas (essentially same time as lurker aspect; send 3 drones mining when it finishes)
21 overlord
21 3 hydras
24 10 more lings (total of 18)
29 2 more drones (Note 1)
31 morph 3 lurkers -> goal is to get a contain with lurker/ling, only bust if mnm left
34 overlord
34 queen's nest
@QueeN's nest done: hive
4 more lurkers, continue massing lings
@hive done: defiler mound
@defiler mound done: consume
4 more lurkers when possible (Note 2)
2 defilers -> send straight to contain, to push in
After defilers built: spire (Note 3)
Keep massing lings
I am going out with 100 supply 2 tanks and a vessel around 9:30
so you need to have faster defiler
