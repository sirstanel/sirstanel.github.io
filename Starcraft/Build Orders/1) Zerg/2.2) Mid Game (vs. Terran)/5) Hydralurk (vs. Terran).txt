When possible get Hydra Speed then Hydra Range

Your goal is to stop the terran's M&M/tank/vessel push. Generally this will happen when you complete hydra range and hydra speed. By this time you should have a saturated third base, 15+ hydras and 12 lurkers. When to engage to is up to you, but ideally stall for as long as possible and try to attack in an open area allowing for a flank. It is very important to make sure both Hydralisks upgrades are completed before engaging the Terran army.

After you stop the push, you should expand to a 4th base, add a spire, continue with +2 carapace and +2 ranged attack, and start hive for defilers. Defilers will initially be used for Dark Swarm to help in either attack or defense. Researching Plague is essential for late game engagements as hydra mow down plagued units.
