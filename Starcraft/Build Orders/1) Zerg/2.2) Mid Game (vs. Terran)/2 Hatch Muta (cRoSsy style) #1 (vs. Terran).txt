2 Hatch Muta (cRoSsy style) #1 (vs. Terran)
  
9 - overlord
12 - hatch in natural
11 - scout
11 - pool
10 - gas
@100% pool 2-4 zerglings
@100 gas - lair
16 - overlord
@100 gas - zergling speed
@100% lair - spire
@100% lair - gas in natural
Note: make drones and lings until 26/26
Note: you should only need 6-8 lings
26 - hatchery at 3rd expo
25 - 2 overlords
Note: stop drone production
@100% spire - 6 muta and +1 flyer attack
Note: make overlords as required
Note: make muta until you have 11
Note: make drones until you saturate your third, get gas after 3-4 drones, keep trickling 1-2 drones during the rest of the build to increase saturation at all bases

If terran moves out to force sunkens before muta, you can:
- opt to make lings instead of drones and make up to 16 lings to smash the force
- make one sunk and defend at home
- threaten to backstab with 6-8 lings and see if they react

If they decide to bust you when you make 1 sunk, pull drones back, let the sunken buy you time, fight with 6-8 muta. The better counter is to make the lings.

If the terran's force is very large you may need 2 sunkens. Usually you don't and usually they only move out and come back to force sunkens. If the terran loses this first m&m group they are behind.
