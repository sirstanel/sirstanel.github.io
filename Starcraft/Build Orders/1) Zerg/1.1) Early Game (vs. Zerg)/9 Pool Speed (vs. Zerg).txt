In general, you want to keep making lings until you scout your opponent. Since you want to be the aggressive player, it may be better to mass lings until spire tech and try to bust them. Here are a few basic tips vs diff opponent openings:

- 9p (mirror): if they are defensive, you can try to bust the ramp but it will be hard. Might be better to go back to ur ramp, make a wall, and drone up (enough so you don't die to their lings)
- 12p expand: mass lings and try to gain an advantage when you have ling speed done. you have a battle adv up until their speed is done. usually they will bring lings + 3 drones, try to pick off drones with your speed. but once they get 2nd hatch + speed up, you need to run away and defend at home
- 12h expand: mass lings and just kill them :)
