6h Before Den (LarvaTurtle Zerg style) (vs. Protoss)

Note: This build forfeits any level of early pressure in exchange for econ. You usually take a far third. You need to scout and modify the build based on what the protoss does. They can do anything they want. This can be a good build at Tier 2/3 as it will frustrate the Protoss. The goal is to control the map with muta and then hold a mid game attack with muta (to snipe high templar) and hydra while transitioning to hydralurk and hive.
