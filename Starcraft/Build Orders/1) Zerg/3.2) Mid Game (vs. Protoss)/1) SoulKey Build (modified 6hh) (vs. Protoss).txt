SoulKey Build (modified 6hh) (vs. Protoss)

- overpool 
- 11 hatchery at 2nd expo
- 13 hatchery at 3rd expo and ~2:50 gas (later gas since we are using hydra to block sair, not scourge)
- when lair finishes, don't get spire but 4th hatch at 27
- 30 hydra den
- 32 5th hatch + 2 hydras/hydra speed (gather all overlords at your natural, 1 overlord to scout p's main)
- 35 gas, evolution chamber, overlord speed, then make drones & hydra range when ready
- around ~6:30 start massing hydras to build up to about 16 hydras at 7:30 for a push
- build 5-6 hydras per base (nat and 3rd) if you need to defend against a corsair counter, this puts you at 16 + 10 = 26 total
- make a round of drones behind the push
- around ~70 get 6th hatch + spire
- ~9min research lurker aspect, make a 4th base, 2-3 scourge to block potential drops and take your 3rd gas
- 2nd evolution chamber when +1 is about to finish
- queen's nest at around 10 minutes
- build a few more hydra just in case p moves out
- when lurker aspect is done and you start making a few lurkers at each base, make drones to saturate your 4th
- around ~10:30, start massing hydra + ling + lurker to stop the 2-0 timing
This build maxes in 13-14 minutes on single player
Jaeyun usually hits ~140 in time for the 2-0 timing
