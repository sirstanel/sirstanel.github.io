6 Hatch Defilers (vs. Protoss)

vs gate expand sometimes I go ling pressure and if run by work I followup with fast muta. I don't know is it worth a recommendation.
I feel 3 hatch hydra/lurk or zerging/lurk are overall stronger and more universal. The problem with the standard play is that it is pretty hard. Macro and micro sim-city unit control, drone to attack units ratio and transition to late game. Now be a new zerg player and remeber all this :smile:
nowdays I play 3 hatch or this build
9 ovi
9 pool
9 scout
11 hatch
1 pair lings
15 gas
15 hatch @ a different natural
15 overlord
16 lair
@100 gas, metabolic boost
20 3 pairs of lings
@100% lair, spire
33 hatch 4
34 hatch 5
hatch 6 at your second main
@100% spire, air carapace + 3-4 pairs scourge
2 sunkens, one at each natural
hydra den, evo chamber, second gas
2x creep colonies at each natural. Normally morph into 1 sunk 1 spore, TBD by enemy build

The whole point of the build is to skip the midgame hydra phase and go straight into ling/lurker/defiler play. Carapace is your key evolution chamber upgrade. I prefer to go muscle > aspect > range rather than muscle > range > aspect, since you're not really fighting with hydras and it makes your lurkers that much faster.

The goal being to fend off the 7:30 push with sunk/spore, a few lings, and drone walking. Unless protoss is attacking, drones should be top priority. 4 base saturation should be at ~8 minutes. Followup is pounding tech, getting ovie speed, hydra speed, queen's nest into really fast hive.
