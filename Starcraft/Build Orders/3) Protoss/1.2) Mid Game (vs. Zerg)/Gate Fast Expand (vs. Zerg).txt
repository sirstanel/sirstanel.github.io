Notes:  In the situations where you are sending zlots out to harass, the objective is to trade well vs lings  and/or kill drones if the opportunity presents itself.  Send zlots behind minerals whenever you can, and wait for backup zlots if Z has too many lings or just retreat entirely.  In the situations where Z starts with 6lings, if you keep your scouting probe alive in his main and dont see additional lings you can move out again quickly with 4zlots to try and hit Z before lingspeed finishes (4:30-5mins if they upgrade it first).  If zerg got gas and you were unable to get any additional scouting info, you should build a 2nd safety cannon at the nat same time as corsair in case Z went 3hatch hydra.
